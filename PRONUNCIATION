Just so we don't end up in a GIF situation where the initial author is wrong about the pronunciation of their creation... The proper pronunciation is "See C. S. V."

You might ask, "There are no vowels in there, how else would I say it?" Well, if you must, the wrong pronunciation is "millemetres five." Anything else you might by trying to say is even more wrong (unless your Czech and saying 'ccsv' like it's written because saying words without vowels is just something you do.)
