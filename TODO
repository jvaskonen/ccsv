Rewrite usage as a perldoc thing
Column Justification
Column Formats (think prepend a dollar sign and colour it red when negative)
Autogen row number support
More tests
support for tsv and other arbitrary delimiters
load default config from file(s)
add border string customization into getopt -- probably rework the border settings into something more like the colour settings
display a slice of a csv (specific rows/columns) rather than the whole thing
Decimal point alignment

Not likely:
Live csv editing
saved per-csv config
formulas and stuff
