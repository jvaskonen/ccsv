Tests? Things just work, right? right?
utf8 data probably doesn't wrap right
support for tsv and other arbitrary delimiters
\r\n csvs probably don't work
load default config from file(s)
force width even when data isn't wide
add border string customization into getopt

Data with spaces wraps funny at 1 column. "abc def" wraps to
a
b
c
d
e
f
Normally you want the space to get eaten when you wrap at a space so this might be fun. wee.
